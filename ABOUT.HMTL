    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>TPS was founded with a simple mission: to raise the standard of landscaping by focusing on reliability, professionalism, and sustainability. What started as a small team serving local neighborhoods quickly grew into a trusted partner for homeowners, HOAs, and commercial properties across Georgia.</p>
    
    <p>Our founders saw a need for a company that not only beautifies outdoor spaces but also values long-term client relationships, fair pricing, and eco-friendly practices. Today, TPS continues to grow while staying true to its commitment of delivering quality with integrity.</p>
    
    <h2>Our Values</h2>

      <li><strong>Trust:</strong> We keep our word and stand behind our work.</li>
      <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Every job is done with care, respect, and precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We implement practices that are safe for the environment and community.</li>
