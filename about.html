    <h2>TPS Story</h2> 
    <p>Jordan Mattox had a simple mission: to raise the standard of lawncare by focusing on reliability, professionalism, and sustainability. What started as a small team serving local neighborhoods quickly grew into a trusted partnership for homeowners, HOAs, and commercial properties across Georgia.</p> 
    
    <p>Our core members saw a need for a company that not only beautifies outdoor spaces but also values long-term client relationships, fair pricing, and eco-friendly practices. Today, TPS continues to grow while staying true to its commitment of delivering quality with integrity.</p> 
    
    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Trust:</strong> We keep our word and stand behind our work.</li>
      <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Every job is done with care, respect, and precision.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> We implement practices that are safe for the environment and community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Founder Foundation | Lawn Boys of ATL</h2>
    <p>The journey began with a youthful lawn service that taught perseverance, teamwork, and the pride of creating something meaningful outdoors. What started with neighborhood yards became the roots of today’s vision—a company built on persistence, detail, and care.</p>

    <p>Years of trial, growth, and resilience shaped Top Performance Services into what it is today: a business with proven operational success, strong industry connections, and a dedicated team capable of managing residential, HOA, and expanding commercial properties. Some of the earliest teammates still contribute, carrying forward history and commitment.</p>

    <p>As TPS looks ahead, the focus is on sustainable growth, new opportunities, and building lasting partnerships. Every service reflects the belief that small efforts create lasting impact and that true quality is found in the details.</p>
